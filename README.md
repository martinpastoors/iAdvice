ICES Advice and assessment history project

Martin Pastoors, 11/11/2018

This project aims to document the history of fish stock assessment, fisheries management advice, management decisions and implementation in the ICES area. Ideally we want to go back in time to recover these histories from old assessment and advice reports. Currently, the databases go back to 1987 and for some stocks even further back to the mid 1970s. 

The codes on this page work with the data stored on the dropbox folder "iAdvice".
